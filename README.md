# RevitPyGeometry
A collection of utils for Revit geometry written in IronPython.
___
## Description

Geometry primitives are wrappers around Revit standard geometry to use existing methods.

[SymPy/geometry](https://docs.sympy.org/latest/modules/geometry/index.html) module is used as a base structure for Revit geometry wrappers.

## Notes
Main purpose is to use it in [pyRevit](https://github.com/eirannejad/pyRevit) until I find a suitable library. So probably it may depend on it in future.

So far I'm working in IronPython 2.7, but may switch to IronPython 3.x in future.

**I will try to keep it compatible with ipy2/3 and independent from other frameworks as long as possible.**
